# Introduction

This Julia code is a complement to the article 

#### [[1]](To appear) : "Proving periodic solutions and branches in the 2D Swift Hohenberg PDE with hexagonal and triangular symmetry, [ArXiv Link](To appear).

It provides the necessary rigorous computations of the bounds presented along the paper. The computations are performed using the package [IntervalArithmetic](https://github.com/JuliaIntervals/IntervalArithmetic.jl). The mathematical objects (spaces, sequences, operators,...) are built using the package [RadiiPolynomial](https://github.com/OlivierHnt/RadiiPolynomial.jl) in combination with the add on [dihedral](https://github.com/dominicblanco/dihedral.jl). Detailed instructions are available in the code to help the user run it.


# The Swift Hohenberg PDE

The Swift Hohenberg PDE
$$0 = -(I_d + \nabla^2)^2 u + \mu u + \nu_1 u^2 + \nu_2 u^3$$
is known to have periodic solutions with hexagonal and triangular symmetry.

## Proof of the symmetry of the solution

The Swift Hohenberg PDE has solutions which are believed to exhibit a wide variety of dihedral symmetries. By dihedral, we mean the symmetry of the n-gon. In Section 2 of [[1]](To appear) we develop the required theory to prove $D_3$ and $D_6$ symmetry of the solution. We also demonstrate that we can generate the periodic pattern using copies of two triangles or one hexagon depending on the symmetry enforced. We perform the analysis to prove these patterns along with their symmetry in Section 3 of [[1]](To appear). 

We provide the candidate solutions, which are given in the files ubar_Th_3_j.jl for j = 5,6,7,8,9,10,11, and 12. These correspond to the approximate solution $\overline{u}$ in Section 3.2. The approximate solution is computed in the code using a Newton method.

Given these approximate solution, each file of the form DjSHPeriodic.jl for j = 3,6 provides the explicit computation of the bounds presented in Section 3 depending on the symmetry enforced in $\overline{u}$. It also provides a value for $r_0$ where the proof is successful. 

## Proving Branches of Solutions

We then demonstrate our approach for proving branches of solutions and their symmetry in Section 4 of [[1]](To appear). This shows that any periodic solution along the branch can be generated by either two triangles or one hexagon. 

We provide the candidate solutions, which are given in the files ubar_Th_4_j.jl for j = 5,6,7,8, and 9. These correspond to the approximate solution $\overline{w}(s)$ in Section 4.1. The approximate solution is computed in the code using a Newton method.

Given these approximate solution, each file of the form DjSHPeriodic_Branch.jl for j = 3,6 provides the explicit computation of the bounds presented in Section 4.2 depending on the symmetry enforced in $\overline{u}(s)$, the second component of $\overline{w}(s)$. It also provides a value for $r_0$ where the proof is successful.
